I have created an API written in python, it enabled all CRUD operations. It manipulates a set of trails that I have stored in a SQL database so they are persistent. I have also documented this API using OpenAPI standards.

In this document you will find documentation for my implementation of the API interface. You will also find a UML diagram for the api, an OpenAPI YAML file, legal, social, ethical and professional concerns and approaches to fix those concerns as well as screenshots of everything working and at the very end an evaluation.

## Background

I had the database basis from the coursework before this one, but there were a couple things that i didnt like or would just like to change anyway. The things ive changed are;

- renamed "order" to "pos" as order is a keyword in SQL
- changed datatype from "text" to "varchar(max)" as text is depreciated
- added "email" property to users table
