I have created an API written in python, it enabled all CRUD operations. It manipulates a set of trails that I have stored in a SQL database so they are persistent. I have also documented this API using OpenAPI standards.

In this document you will find documentation for my implementation of the API interface. You will also find a UML diagram for the api, an OpenAPI YAML file, legal, social, ethical and professional concerns and approaches to fix those concerns as well as screenshots of everything working and at the very end an evaluation.

## Design

I have changed the design of the db slightly, I have rename order to pos because order is a keyword so it has to be wrapped in brackets whereas pos it not. Also changed datatype text to varchar(max) as text was depreciated. I also added email to users.Background
